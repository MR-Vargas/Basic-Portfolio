           <p> 
            Hi, im Enrique but everyone calls me Rico. Im 28yrs old and curretly working for a solar company 
            called Sunpower. I went to school to become a Electrician but havent had much luck or interest. So instead I 
            decided to switch carrers and focus on something I truly care about Technlogy and Fighting. Your probably asking 
            yourself what does a carrer in technology and fighting look like, well simply having the freedom to work from anywhere 
            coding and fighting on my downtime. Yes that means I am a fighter. Muay Thai to be exact, with a record of 2-0. Im also ENFP-T & 
            have an Urban Old Soul. Which just means I value honesty & respect. With this carrer change I hope to be able to
            work from home and have more time to explore other things in life, have more time to spend with my future childern and get 
            back into the fight scene.
